This document describes the technique that can be used in order to replace any of the GPLv3 open source software components running on the HD300:

1. Go into Setup->System Information and type '5309' on your remote control, a blue dot should appear in the top left hand corner of the screen
2. Go into Setup->Advanced Setup->General and enable 'Debug Logging'
3. Go into Setup->Advanced Setup->Server and enable the Windows File Server
4. Exit out to the main menu and power cycle the device
5. There should now be an SMB share exposed from the device called 'InternalFlash'. Place any modified files/folders you want to use in here.
6. Telnet into the device and login as 'root'
7. Create a file named /rw/startupmods which has executable permissions; it should be a shell script (i.e. leading with '#!/bin/sh')
8. Either editing the file over SMB, or locally with 'vi'; you can replace components of the filesystem with lines such as this:
mount -o bind /rw/samba /app/samba
9. Save the startupmods file and reboot the box. When it comes back up it will be using the modified versions of the files from /rw.
